# Image-Filters-GUI
This GUI app allows users to load grayscale images, apply filters (like Sobel, Prewitt, Laplacian, etc.), define custom filters, and save processed images. Built with Tkinter and OpenCV, itâ€™s ideal for visualizing and experimenting with edge detection, line detection, and other image processing techniques.
